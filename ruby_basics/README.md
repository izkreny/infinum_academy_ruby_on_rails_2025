# Infinum Backend Academy: Homework Ruby

## Setup

Before starting to work on your homework assignments, setup development environment by running
`bin/setup` script which installs all necessary dependencies.

## Playing with solutions

Starting a console, `bin/console`, will import all your code into interactive ruby session, where you can
experiment with your solutions.

## Runing specs

Specs verify that your solution satisfies all expectations:
  * whole suite                                 (`rspec`)
