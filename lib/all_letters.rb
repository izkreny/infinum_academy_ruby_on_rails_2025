# Implement a function that checks if every single letter of the alphabet is
# used in a sentence at least once (case is irrelevant). Function returns true
# or false.

# Ignore numbers and punctuation
#
# Examples:
#  "A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog." => true
#  "Here are some letters missing" => false
